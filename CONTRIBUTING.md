# Contributors Guide

Are you interested in helping out?

Have a few minutes to tackle an issue?

In this guide we will get you setup into contributing to our project!

## Setting up your development environment

We recommend using the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager for your environments.

Our recommended setup for contributing is:

1. Install [mambaforge](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) on your system.
You may have to restart your prompt for the remaining steps to work.

2. Now, with a local clone, of your fork you can create a development environment with:

    ```shell
    mamba env create -f reqs/base.yml
    mamba env update -f reqs/dev.yml
    mamba activate xpublish-host
    pip install -e .
    pre-commit install
    ```

3. Tests can be run locally by running the `pytest` command from the cloned repository root.

4. The changes should be made via GitHub pull requests against the `main` branch.
